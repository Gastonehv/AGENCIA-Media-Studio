// A text with e.g. font-size: 12px does not always get rendered with 12px
// With "Arial", it gets rendered with 13.5px height, with SF Pro, it gets
// rendered with 14px height. I therefore conclude there is no logic
// and we need to measure it. I rendered the string "1", "a" and "qË" and
// they all have the same height, so it doesn't matter if certain characters
// go low or high.
